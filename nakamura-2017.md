* We discovered that exogenous administration of
short chain fatty acids (intestinal bacterial metabolites of dietary fiber fermentation) attenuated uveitis in a mouse
strain-dependent manner through induction of regulatory T cells in various tissues, as well as its suppressive
impact on effector T cells. 
* We showed that intestinal morphology and gene expression were altered in the EAU
model prior to the onset of uveitis, and that some of these changes were blunted by oral SCFA administration.
* Finally, we, for the first time, also demonstrated the migration of leukocytes between the gastrointestinal tract
and the eye in uveitis, and also showed that SCFAs reduced the migration of effector T cells between the intestine
and the spleen during EAU. We and others have demonstrated the importance of the intestinal microbiome in
the pathogenesis of uveitis4,29,30. 

Multiple mechanisms including the generation of SCFA potentially account for
this effect. The demonstration that lymphocytes migrate from the intestine to the eye adds a new dimension to
understanding the connection between the intestine and uveitis, especially in diseases such as Crohnâ€™s disease,
ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis, since bowel and eye inflammation
co-exist in each of these conditions31,32.
